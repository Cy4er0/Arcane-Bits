    <h1>Arcane Bits</h1>
    <p id="text">in a dim lighted dungon you woke up with no memory of anything.
        not how you got here , not why,no detail about who you are , or what is 
        your mision.
        the only clue you have is a fait echo in your brain , that want you to move forward.
        as you overcome the diziness and open your eyes you see two paths.
